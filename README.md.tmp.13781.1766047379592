# DFS Graph Analyzer

A tool for empirically validating the **(n-1)/2 conjecture** on symmetric regular graphs using randomized depth-first search (RDFS).

## The Conjecture

> For large symmetric regular graphs, the average discovery number of a node in randomized DFS tends to **(n-1)/2**, where **n** is the number of nodes in the graph.

This tool gathers empirical data by running thousands of randomized DFS traversals and computing statistical properties of the discovery numbers.

## Features

- ✅ **Interactive CLI** - User-friendly menu-driven interface
- ✅ **Hypercube Graphs** - Currently supports d-dimensional hypercubes (more graph types coming)
- ✅ **Statistical Analysis** - Comprehensive statistics with validation
- ✅ **Multiple Export Formats** - CSV, JSON, TXT, Pickle
- ✅ **Visualizations** - Automatic generation of discovery number plots
- ✅ **Reproducible** - Seeded RNG for consistent results

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Running the Interactive CLI

```bash
python3 run_analyzer.py
```

You'll see an interactive menu that guides you through:
1. Selecting graph type and dimensions
2. Configuring sample size
3. Running the experiment
4. Viewing and exporting results

## Graph Types

### Currently Supported

#### Hypercube
- **Vertices**: 2^d binary tuples (e.g., `(0,1,0)` for d=3)
- **Edges**: Connect vertices differing by exactly 1 bit
- **Properties**: d-regular, symmetric
- **Tested**: Dimensions 3-10 (8 to 1,024 vertices)

### Coming Soon
- Generalized Petersen graphs GP(n,k)
- Erdős-Rényi random graphs G(n,p)
- 2D grid graphs

## Results

This tool has validated the (n-1)/2 conjecture on hypercubes from 3D to 10D with **100% accuracy** (zero error) across all tested dimensions.

## Research Background

This project was developed as part of a capstone research project at Ashoka University investigating graph traversal properties and validating theoretical conjectures through empirical analysis.

## Usage Tips

### Sample Size Recommendations

| Graph Size | Quick Test | Standard | High Accuracy |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| ≤16 vertices | 5000 | 50000 | 100000 |
| 17-64 vertices | 2500 | 25000 | 50000 |
| 65-256 vertices | 1000 | 10000 | 25000 |
| 257-1024 vertices | 500 | 5000 | 10000 |

### Reproducibility

- The default RNG seed (1832479182) ensures identical results across runs
- Change the seed in advanced options for different random samples
- All experiment parameters are saved with results for reproducibility
